Inspirations:
    Unity Technologies for making an easy-to-use game engine (Unity Engine). BaconEditor is based off their Unity editor.
    Valve for making a very mod friendly game engine (Source Engine). Most of this game engine (i.e. commands, each client being their own binary) was inspired by their engine.
    Hazel Engine for getting me into game engine development, this game engine probably wouldn't exist otherwise.

Thanks:
    Microsoft for making their documentation easy to understand
    Silicon Graphics/Khronos Group for making the easy-to-use OpenGL
    GLFW/Glad for making modern OpenGL not a pain to use
    AMD/DICE/Khronos Group for making the powerful Vulkan API
    Apple for making the Metal API (your documentation isn't very good, though)

If anyone has good documentation on how the Metal API works, then I'll be forever grateful
