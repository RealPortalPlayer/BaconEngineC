# BaconEngine

BaconEngine is a small engine that I've been working on for quite a while.

## Setup

### SDL

First, you're going to need SDL installed. There's many ways to do that, but this is how I did it:

* [Make sure you have git installed.](https://git-scm.com/)
* Get SDL by running: `git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL`
* Enter the folder, and make a new folder called: `build`
* Enter that build folder and run: `cmake ..`
* After that finishes, run: `make`
* Then finally, run `sudo make install`

### BaconEngine

You can now compile BaconEngine. Just run `make`, and it should compile.
